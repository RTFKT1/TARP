## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

In the medical field, the development of gadgets is underway to revolutionize how bodily measurements like blood pressure and heart rate are automatically tracked. One significant aspect is the intravenous (IV) drip mode for delivering medications directly into the blood circulation. This project introduces an autonomous IV drip monitoring system that incorporates drip rate measurement, blood pressure, and pulse rate monitoring, aiming to enhance healthcare efficiency.

## Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>

The system utilizes a minimalistic circuit design to monitor intravenous infusion, working with varying optical transmittivity in drip chamber walls and different IV fluid types. The system is designed to operate with fluctuating battery supply voltage without the need for a regulator, contributing to energy efficiency. Notifications are sent to healthcare professionals via GSM technology, and a solenoid valve is employed to automatically stop the liquid flow from the IV bag.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

- **Drip Rate Measurement:** Accurate monitoring of intravenous drip rates.
- **Health Parameters Monitoring:** Continuous tracking of blood pressure and pulse rate.
- **Energy-Efficient Design:** Operates with fluctuating battery supply voltage without a regulator.
- **GSM Notifications:** Automatic alerts sent to healthcare professionals.
- **Solenoid Valve Control:** Enables automated cessation of liquid flow from the IV bag.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple management via mobile software.
